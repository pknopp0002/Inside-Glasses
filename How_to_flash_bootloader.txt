The Cortex-M0 micro-chip, that is used on the printed circuit board, comes blank from the manufacturer
and will need a bootloader binary file flashed to the chip to make it work. This is the same micro-chip
that the Adafruit Trinket M0 uses and the company provides detailed steps on the equipment needed
and the steps used to upload the bootloader onto the chip. The link below will help with this
process.
